## Ether Bank, Making Zero Interest Loans for Ether HODLers

### What is Ether Bank?
* Ether Bank is a smart contract that receives Ether as collateral and provides zero interest loans with no due payback time.  
* Ether Bank loans helps Ether HODLers pay for their expenditures without having to sell their Ethers.
* The loans are in form of Ether dollars that are stablecoins created by Ether Bank and backed by Ether.
* Ether dollar does not depreciate in accordance with the inflations in the United States. 1 Ether dollar is worth as much as the purchasing power of a US dollar in 2014 which was the year Ethereum network initiated. Since US dollar depreciated by 6% during 2014 and 2018, an Ether dollar is worth 1.06 US dollars in 2018.

### How Does Ether Bank Ensures Stability of Ether Dollar?
* Ether Bank has a simple strategy for maintaining value. It creates Ether dollars to an extent that the supply is equal to the demand in the market. In other words, new Ether dollars are created when demand is increased and existing Ether dollars are eliminated when demand is decreased.
* Unlike other Cryptoassets, newly created tokens are not awarded. They are rather issued as loans. The tokens are created by paying loans and eliminated by settling them.
* Issuing new tokens by paying loans instead of awarding them enables Ether Bank to maintain the value of Ether dollar by eliminating some of the existing tokens when the demand for them decreases in the market. Elimination is done through settling some of the loans.



| Cryptoassets | Ether dollar |
| ------------ | ------------ |
| Supply is a function of time | Supply is a function of demand |
| They are created over time and can never be destroyed after being created | They are created when demand for holding them increases and destroyed when demand decreases |
| Newly created tokens are awarded, so there is no way to destroy them after creation | Newly created tokens are paid as loans, so they can easily be destroyed by settlement |
| When demand increases, their market is balanced by the rise of the price | When demand increases, their market is balanced by creation of new tokens |
| When demand decreases, their market is balanced by the fall of the price | When demand decreases, their market is balanced by destruction of previously created tokens |
| Supply is stable just like gold | Price is stable just like money |



### How is Ether Dollar Created or Eliminated?
* Every client can receive Ether dollar loans from Ether Bank by making a deposit of at least 1.5 times the size of their requested loan in Ether as collateral.
* The loans with collaterals that are worth less than 1.5 times the value of the loan according to Ether market prices will be liquidated.
* Liquidation means that Ether Bank puts the loan’s collateral for sale. This way everyone can settle the loan on behalf of the receiver and win a part of their collateral. In other words, everyone can buy loan receiver’s collateral by paying Ether dollars. After the sale, the remains of the collateral are paid back to the loan receiver and the Ether dollars are eliminated by Ether Bank. 
* The price for liquidation is determined in the market, so, those who buy a part of the collateral to settle the loan benefit to some extent and those whose loans are settled by others lose to some extent.
* Due to volatility of Ether, loan receivers have to make deposits worth more than 1.5 times the amount of their loans and, add to their loan collateral in case Ether price decreases, otherwise their loans will face liquidation risk.
* Every time the price of Ether dollar is less than its peg, in addition to the loans with collaterals worth less than 1.5 times the value of the loan, other loans with lower amounts of collateral compared to others are also liquidated. This causes Ether dollar supply to always be in coordination with its demand. This way, only Ether dollar loans with the highest amounts of  collateral remain. 
* There is no obligation or time limit to settle the loans in Ether Bank. Clients can settle their loans whenever they intend to unless liquidation is applicable for them.
* Ether Bank never prohibits loans with collaterals equal to or slightly higher than 1.5 times their amount. However, every time these loans have a lower amount of collateral compared to others, and the price of Ether dollars is less than its peg, they are instantly liquidated with some loss for the loan receivers and some benefit for the settlers.

### How is Ether Dollar different from other stablecoins?
* Unlike fiat backed stablecoins, Ether dollar is decentralized and is not faced to counterparty risks. Moreover, it does not lose its value with the depreciation of fiat currency values.
* Unlike non-collateralized stablecoins, Ether dollar can maintain its stability even if the demand for it reaches zero. This is done through settling all loans and decreasing the supply to zero. Non-collateralized stablecoins on the other hand, will face critical problems not only if their demand reaches zero, but also in case of long term decreases in demand for their tokens. Therefore, the risk of losing the peg is much higher in non-collateralized stablecoins compared to collateralized ones.
* Other crypto-collateralized stablecoins define an additional token besides their stable one in order to use it as their governance token or as the collateral that backs their loans. In contrast, There is no such token in Ether dollar.
    * Tokens that are used as collateral in a stablecoin system enjoys a high demand. Those who define their own token as collateral tend to be after the benefits of this high demand for themself. But, relying on a weak token with a low market cap will eventually heighten the risk of their stable token. The loans in Ether dollar are backed by Ether. This way both Ether and Ether dollar mutually benefit from each other. Ether dollar enjoys the benefits of relying on a robust token with a huge market cap. And Ether enjoys a higher demand due to its use as collateral.
    * Ether dollar believes that a cryptocurrency should be robust by the rule of law and not in the hands of investors and their decisions through consensus or what not. Stablecoins with governance tokens provide opportunities for their investors to modify the system to their own benefit and not to the benefits of stablecoin lenders and holders. For instance, one can easily observe the reasons behind the sudden 5x rise in the stability fees of Maker to the benefits of MKR holders. When in fact, this rise could have been in the saving rate and to the benefit of DAI holders.
* The elimination of additional tokens not only makes Ether dollar a zero cost solution for its clients but also extremely lowers the complexity of the system and minimizes the risks.


### How Does the Monetary Policy in Ether Dollar Minimize the Risk?
* The most significant risk for collateral based stablecoins is their collateral losing value to the extent that it is worth less than the loan. Ether Bank’s monetary policy maximizes the collaterals deposited by loan receivers to minimize this risk.
* The loans in Ether Bank are completely free and clients pay no interest. There is also no time limit for paying back the loan and clients can settle their loans whenever they want to. The only requirement for receiving a loan is providing enough Ethers as collateral. This approach creates a huge demand in those who own Ethers and can provide them as collateral to receive free loans.
* But the loans are limited in Ether Bank, because, every time the demand for receiving free loans from Ether Bank exceeds the demand for holding Ether dollars, the price of Ether dollars falls and the peg breaks.
* In these circumstances, in order to reduce Ether dollar supply, Ether Bank forcibly settles the loans with the lowest amount of collateral by liquidating them. This will create a competition among loan receivers not to have lower amounts of collateral compared to others. This competition increases the collateral needed for receiving loans to an extent where the demand for receiving loans is equal to the demand for holding Ether dollars.
* Considering an interest paid by the loans receivers to Ether dollar holders could have been another approach for facing price falls. But, the monetary policy behind Ether dollar aims to minimize the risk rather than maximize the interest. What creates such interest is an increase in the risk. 
* Increasing the amount of collateral instead of the interest rates results in Ether dollar enjoying minimum risk and maximum reliability as the most significant feature of an ideal money. This mechanism turns Ether dollar to an ideal money and unit of account in the Ethereum ecosystem.

### How does Ether Dollar Enjoy Lower Risks Compared to Other Kinds of Money?
Assets and money are both stores of value. Those who intend to maximize their profit, tend to store value in assets, while, others who intend to minimize risks, store value in money. So an ideal money is the one with minimum risk of losing its value. The advantage of Ether dollar over its competitors is its emphasis on minimizing the risk.

#### Lower Risk Compared to Dollar.
* Unlike Federal Reserve Bank, Ether Bank automatically targets zero inflation through an immutable smart contract.
* Banks do not ask for collateral when they create dollars by paying loans. Ether Bank on the other hand asks for a collateral that is worth much more than the loan in order to create Ether dollars.

#### Lower Risk Compared to Fiat-Backed Stablecoins.
* Not only because it does not have counterparty risks, but also because it has lower risks than fiat money to begin with.  

#### Lower Risk Compared to Other Crypto-Backed Stablecoins
* Unlike other similar stablecoins, Ether Bank has a highly simple and intelligible approach in creating Ether dollars.
* Unlike other similar stablecoins, Ether dollar is designed to have maximum amount of collateral for the loans, therefore, the default risk for loans in case collateral prices fall is minimized.
